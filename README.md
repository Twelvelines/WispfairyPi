# WispfairyPi
Meager scripts for enabling and disabling Raspberry Pi as eth-to-wlan bridge. Based on [the very tutorial on Raspberry Pi Documentation Website][1].Please see the content for how the files should be prepared. 

## Dis(?)-feature (Disclaimer)
1. Not atomic
2. No validation for the presumptions and intermediate results of execution
3. Meager
4. Really meager
101. Meager
102. Welcoming for pull requests (well it is probably a good one)

## Presumptions
1. System: Raspbian
2. hostapd and brctl installed
3. Files for both enabled and disabled state are prepared and named accordingly (see the commands in scripts I'm too lay-zy)
