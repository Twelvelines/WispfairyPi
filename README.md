# WispfairyPi
Meager scripts for enabling and disabling Raspberry Pi as eth-to-wlan bridge, solely for personal, makeshift and conceptual purposes. Based on [the very tutorial on Raspberry Pi Documentation Website][1]. Please see the content of it for how the files should be prepared. 

## Dis-features
1. Not atomic
2. No validation for any presumptions or intermediate results of execution
3. Meager
4. Really meager
5. Not subject to any judging because I am already a loser and noob and not good at computer and stuff

## Presumptions
1. System: Raspbian
2. hostapd and brctl installed
3. Files for both enabled and disabled state are prepared and named accordingly
