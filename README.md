### (Might be outdated)

*As I found out the other day when I checked out their website that they have updated the corresponding documentation in context of this script's functionality, the script might very well need an update or at least another test run to be deemed functional, either of which I am unable to do for my current lack of 'Pi arround me. Nevertheless I hope it can be at least be some guidance, food for thought or point of direction for anybody that might need it.*

Meager scripts for enabling and disabling Raspberry Pi as eth-to-wlan bridge, solely for personal, makeshift and conceptual purposes. Based on [the very tutorial on Raspberry Pi Documentation Website][1]. Please see the content of it for how the files should be prepared. 

## Dis-features
1. Not atomic
2. No validation for any presumptions or intermediate results of execution
3. Meager
4. Really meager
5. Not subject to any judging because I am already a loser and noob and not good at computer and stuff

## Presumptions
1. System: Raspbian
2. hostapd and brctl installed
3. Files for both enabled and disabled state are prepared and named accordingly
